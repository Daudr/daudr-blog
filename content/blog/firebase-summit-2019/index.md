The Firebase Summit 2019 took place on the 26th of September in Madrid and I had the honor to attend. In this article, I'll talk about the various (and cool) new features that have been announced.

There has been a lot of news on this event, let me tell you about them:

## Firebase Emulator Suite

One of the most interesting additions is **Firebase Emulator Suite**, this suite will let the developer have faster and safer development experience and don't forget about the speed gained since you'll have everything locally with **Hot Reloading** when your **Cloud Functions** or your **Security Rules** change.

You'll find a very detailed guid on the new [google.dev firebase codelabs](https://google.dev/playlists/firebase-emulators) 🤩🤩🤩

## Firebase Extensions

![Firebase Extensions](https://firebase.google.com/images/products/mods/mods-2.png)

Another cool update are the **Firebase Extensions**, these will let you add some functionalities (like translating, resizing images, etc.) without writing a single line of code. Firebase has released these open source, and it plans to let developers create their own extensions, how modular!

## Google Analytics for Firebase

[**Introduction to Google Analytics for Firebase**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Y4PgwlW-Q)

Another great addition is the possibility to add **Google Analytics** to your web and native applications. It's a great addition because it'll let you create custom audiences based on your users' usage (and we'll see why this is important next).

## Remote Config

![Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/images/products/remote-config/remote-config-1.png)

Also, **Remote config** is being added to Web projects, it'll let you change the look and feel of your apps by enabling them in just a click, selecting the audience you want to see the changes. You can use the audiences created with Analytics to have a better reach too.

## Firebase Cloud Messaging

![Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/images/products/cloud-messaging/cloud-messaging-5.png)

**Firebase Cloud Messaging** will be added to Web Projects too, and it'll let yuo send targeted Messages to users that use your app. It's just like **Push Notifications**, but better! 💌💌💌

## Firebase App Distribution

![Firebase App Distibution](https://firebase.google.com/images/products/app-distribution/app-distro-2.png)

**Firebase App Distribution** will let you release an early preview of your apps to the users you want, and it'll let you see all the stats about the usage of these previews.

## Firebase Test Lab

![Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/images/products/test-lab/test-lab-3.png)

**Firebase Test Lab** is a cloud-based app-testing infrastructure. With one operation, you can test your Android or iOS app across a wide variety of devices and device configurations, and see the results  -  including logs, videos, and screenshots  -  in the Firebase console.

> Firebase Test Lab at Firebase Summit

Test Lab uses real, production devices running in a Google data center to test your app. The devices are flashed with updated APIs and have customizable locale settings, allowing you to road-test your app on the hardware and configurations it'll encounter in real-world use

## Firebase Predictions

![Firebase Predictions](https://firebase.google.com/images/products/predictions/predictions-1.png)

**Firebase Predictions** applies **machine learning** to your analytics data to create dynamic user segments based on your users' predicted behavior. These predictions are automatically available for use with **Firebase Remote Config**, the **Notifications composer**, **Firebase In-App Messaging**, and **A/B Testing**. You can also export your app's Predictions data to **BigQuery** for further analysis or to push to third party tools.
